# Build-A-Bullet

Mobile game that combines the genres of clicker-games and bullet-hell games


# Alpha 0.1

This is an alpha 0.1 of the game. Basic things such as a simple store and simple game is made. The next version plans to have a more grid-like playing system, along with expanded store UI.

If things go horribly wrong with the grid-like redesign, this is a rollback version to start all over.

Godspeed, future Christian.
